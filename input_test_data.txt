LONDON Designers took inspiration from geometry, the 1980s and British uniforms for their London Fashion Week creations over the weekend, with more labels selling items hot off the catwalk as they adopt the runway to a retail business model.
High street brand Topshop became the latest to offer customers the chance to buy designs straight after its show on Sunday, where models wore zebra print designs and skirts slashed at the thigh.
Embellished dresses and voluminous jackets added to an 1980s feel.
Topshop said that for the first time key items modeled on the runway would be immediately available for purchase.
"For a high street brand like Topshop that's kind of affordable ... it's great that you can then see it on the catwalk and get it straight away," singer Foxes said at the show.
Luxury label Burberry, which presents its womenswear and menswear collections on Monday, announced in February it would begin selling runway items in-store and online immediately after its September show.
Fashionistas usually wait months for seasonal catwalk lines to hit shops.
With customers living in different climates around the world and with many shows now streamed live, several brands have been adopting the new model on different scales - selling select items or just accessories seen on the catwalk.
London Fashion Week runs over five days until Tuesday and others showing their spring/summer 2017 lines on Sunday included accessories designer Anya Hindmarch who brought a space age vision to the capital.
Models wearing white head bands walked a white circular catwalk, donning colorful coats and handbags - in aquamarine, lilac and coral - decorated with geometric shapes.
"This season I've been preoccupied by the relationship between geometry and art.
These two visual mediums are both articulated through pattern, form and color - things that have always fascinated me," Hindmarch said in a statement.
At Mulberry, creative director Johnny Coca turned to British uniforms - military, school as well as suits and country wear - showing plenty of olive 1940s-style jackets and skirts, pinstripe navy and burgundy blazers and paisley creations.
Models wore ruffled pinafore and silk dresses, asymmetric patterned skirts as well as round-collared jackets and shorts.
"There's always a reference to British heritage, but it's about how we can use tradition, to make it feel modern.
How we can break the rules, to make it new," Coca said in show notes.

• Former Uefa president Lennart Johansson led the way on to pitch• Idea was part of campaign to promote discounts for older people The Swedish club AIK tried a new initiative at the weekend, when the oldest living members of the club entered the pitch as mascots for their league match against Gefle IF.
The senior citizens replaced the regular mascots with the former Uefa president and honorary club president, Lennart Johansson, leading the way.
The idea was part of a campaign to promote ticket discounts and free shuttle buses to and from retirement homes.
Johansson, who came on to the field to a rapturous reception with his fellow mascots, said: “There are a lot of us who have lived with AIK all of our lives but who can’t, for various reasons, get to the stadium these days.
That doesn’t mean that we care less about the club.
Maybe just that we have a little bit more difficulty travelling and moving around.” The AIK chairman, Mikael Ahlerup, commented: “Our family section has for a long time been the biggest in Sweden and it is very important for us to get children and teenagers to the club but we can never forget about the generation that made this club to what it is.
That’s why this initiative felt like an obvious thing to do.
“A family should consist of both young and old and today we completed our family by inviting and celebrating the elders.
I’m proud to be a part of such an inclusive club,” he added.
AIK came out on top in the match, their 1-0 win taking them to third place in the table.
The U.S. Coast Guard continues to search for two adults and one child who went missing while boating on Lake Superior Saturday night.
Rescue crews searched for 20 hours over an area of approximately 1,500 miles, focusing on the area near the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the Coast Guard reported in a news release.
The group was in a 14-foot recreational boat, owned by Keith Karvonen, one of the missing individuals.
The Coast Guard did not name the other two people missing.
The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City, Coast Guard Air Station Detroit, Coast Guard Station Marquette, Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina and the Canadian Coast Guard have assisted in the search.
A crew from Air Station Cape Cod, Massachusetts was scheduled to search throughout Sunday night and into Monday morning.
Anyone with any information about this case is urged to contact the Coast Guard Sector Sault Sainte Marie command center at (906) 635-3233.
The internet can be a “playground for paedophiles”, the NSPCC has warned after new figures suggested increasing numbers of children are raising concerns about online abuse and grooming.
Statistics from Childline, a service provided by the charity, show counselling sessions for youngsters worried about online sexual abuse jumped by 24% to 3,716 in 2015/16.
Most of those contacting the facility were aged between 12 and 15, and more than half were girls.
The online abuse category covers issues including grooming, sexual harassment and communications, pressure to engage in or view explicit material online and sexual extortion.
One in eight of the counselling sessions in 2015/16 were related specifically to grooming - an increase of 21%, the NSPCC said.
The charity’s chief executive Peter Wanless said: “Most of us talk to people online and it’s a great way to stay connected and make new friends.
“But it can be a playground for paedophiles, exposing young people to groomers who trawl social networks and online game forums exploiting any vulnerabilities they may find.” Childline founder Esther Rantzen said the internet has brought many positive changes.
“But it has also brought dangers and online grooming is a real risk,” she said.
Childine is launching a new campaign titled Listen To Your Selfie which is aimed at helping young people recognise the signs of grooming and unhealthy relationships, both online and offline.
Mr Wanless said: “We hope that by putting this in the spotlight we can help young people to feel able to speak up if they feel worried or scared about a situation or relationship.”
Hastings United's footballers have been handed a fourth consecutive away tie in the FA Cup.
The draw for third round qualifying, made this lunchtime (Monday), has given United a trip to Margate in third round qualifying on Saturday October 1.
The U's have come three rounds to get to this stage, all of them away from home and all of them with clean sheets.
Their latest victory was a 1-0 win at Barton Rovers in second round qualifying on Saturday.
But the next game will represent a big step up in difficulty for Ryman Football League Division One South side United, who will be up against a Margate team which plays two levels above them in National League South.
The U's and Walton Casuals are the only Ryman Division One South clubs definitely through to FA Cup third round qualifying as things stand, although Faversham Town and Herne Bay could join them if they win their replays.
United's away cup draws haven't just been confined to the FA Cup.
They have also been drawn away in the first two rounds of the Ryman League Alan Turvey Trophy, sponsored by Robert Dyas, and in FA Trophy first round qualifying.
As previously reported, tomorrow night's scheduled league game at home to Faversham has been postponed because the Kent club has an FA Cup replay against Hitchin Town tonight.

Adil Rashid has defended his request to be left out of Yorkshire’s final County Championship match of the season, with the England spinner citing “personal reasons” for his absence.
The 28-year-old will not feature in the potential title decider against Middlesex, which begins at Lord’s on Tuesday, after asking the coach Jason Gillespie if he could be excused because he needed to rest ahead of England’s tour to Bangladesh.
Gillespie, who is taking charge of his final match, admitted on Sunday that he was “frustrated” by Rashid’s decision.
But in a statement posted on his Twitter account on Monday, Rashid insisted the main reason was that a family member had also been admitted to hospital.
“Unfortunately I have not travelled down with the Yorkshire lads this week as one of my closest family members has been very ill and was recently admitted to hospital,” read the statement.
“I didn’t feel that I am in a strong enough mental frame of mind to be at my best, although I did make myself available if I was required to play [if] I felt I could be letting the lads down.
But coupled with my personal reasons I have also had a heavy period of cricket recently for Yorkshire and England which has been both physically and mentally draining and it is very unfortunate timing.
“Family comes first for me and I will be away on England duty this winter with a busy playing schedule.
I have been in touch with the Yorkshire players and coaches and I will be wishing the lads all the best this game and I am desperately hoping we can lift the trophy for a 3rd year in a row.” On Sunday, Andrew Gale, the Yorkshire captain, posted on Twitter: “Training all done, head down to Lords [sic] tomorrow, can’t wait.
This squad is ready to run through a brick wall for the county.
Yes, he wants to rest.
That’s his decision.
I’ll take 11 lads on the field who will give everything to win.”
A hotline has been launched to encourage landlords and tenants to report energy theft.
The anonymous service targets crime such as such as tampering with meters, which is estimated to cost the UK more than £400million a year.
Anyone with suspicions will be able to report these either by calling the dedicated phone number, 0800 023 2777, or by doing so online at www.stayenergysafe.co.uk.
Dermot Nolan, of Ofgem, said: “Energy theft costs the UK hundreds of millions of pounds each year and puts people’s lives at risk.
“This is why we’re working with the energy industry to clamp down on this crime.” Crimestoppers’ Mark Hallas said: “It’s no exaggeration to say that this is a groundbreaking agreement that we have forged with the energy industry to ensure that crimes such as meter tampering are clamped down on.
“This isn’t just about supporting the industry, though, it’s about our duty to the communities we work with.
“Explosions and fires as a result of energy theft can be devastating, which is why we are running this service on behalf of the industry, to ensure our streets are safe.”
Despite that satisfied look on their faces when they are busy gnawing away on them, dogs should not be given bones, vets are increasingly warning.
The UK’s leading veterinary charity the PDSA has taken to instructing owners not to give their dogs either cooked or raw bones, which it says can become lodged in their throats or splinter, damaging their stomach or intestines and sometimes killing them.
Its spokesman said: “We don’t recommend bones as treats because we often see dogs with digestive tract damage and blockages caused by splinters or larger pieces of bone becoming stuck.
“Surgery is usually needed to remove any blockage and, in some cases, the damage is so serious that it can be fatal.
“Similarly, if they swallow a large piece of rawhide chew this can become stuck and cause serious problems.” The warning runs contrary to widely-held beliefs about the benefits to the animals’ dental health and digestion of chewing on a bone.
A lobby group called the Raw Meaty Bones Action Group claims vets are biased in favour of prepared commercial food.
Meanwhile, The Dog’s Trust states in a factsheet about feeding that while cooked bones are “very dangerous”, large meaty bones have benefits and can even reduce some dogs’ anxiety by causing particular chemicals to be released in their brains.
The British Veterinary Association has said there is no scientific evidence to demonstrate any benefits of feeding dogs raw meat and bones, however, and has highlighted further risks including salmonella.
Three years ago Tesco withdrew a type of ham bone dog treat from sale after a miniature schnauzer died when it splintered, rupturing his stomach.
The PDSA earlier this year said stones, babies’ dummies, socks and kebab sticks were among hundreds of items its vets had surgically removed the stomachs of dogs over 12 months.
